# Automatic Cell Tuner `(act)`

## Overview

Automatic Cell Tuner (ACT) is a workflow for semi-automated tuning of somatic conductances of biophysical cell models. 
ACT implements the functional current segmentation approach (Alturki et al., 2016) allowing for modular opitmization that effectively constrains the parameter space and reduces the search time.

## Installation

Currently, only installation from source is supported.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/V-Marco/ACT.git
pip install .
```

## Usage

See the documentation page for examples and the API reference.
