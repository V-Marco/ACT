# `act` Example

`CA3_test.ipynb` contains examples on different optimizers provided by `act`. 

Before running, make sure the modfiles are compiled, i.e., you have a `x86_64` folder together with all other files required by `act`.

Due to `neuron`'s caching, sometimes the notebook's cells throw errors when attempted to be re-run (e.g., an indexing error). In such an error is thrown, just re-run a cell one more time.
